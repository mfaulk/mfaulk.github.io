## The Evolution of Zero-Knowledge Proofs: A Timeline and Comparison

The field of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) has seen some amazing advances in the last several years. All of that progress, though, makes it difficult to keep up with the state of the art and see how all the pieces fit together. This post is my (ongoing) attempt to follow the impactful developments and trace some of the lines of inquiry.

## A Timeline
- [1989] The knowledge complexity of interactive proof-systems. Introduces the concept of zero knowledge proofs
- [2008] Valiant: Incrementally Verifiable Computation
- [2010] Constant-Size Commitments to Polynomials and Their Applications. KZG commitments
- [2014] Scalable Zero Knowledge via Cycles of Elliptic Curves. First "practical" proof recursion
- [2013] Recursive composition and bootstrapping for SNARKS and proof-carrying data. Succinctness
- [2016] On the Size of Pairing-based Non-interactive Arguments. Succinctness
- [2016] Efficient Zero-Knowledge Arguments for Arithmetic Circuits in the Discrete Log Setting (Inner Product Argument)
- [2018] Updatable and Universal Common Reference Strings with Applications to zk-SNARKs

Way, way back in the 1980's, [Goldwasser, Micali, and Rackoff](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/22145.22178) introduced the concept of a zero-knowledge proof, an interactive proof system where a prover can convince a verifier that a statement is true *without revealing any additional information* beyond the validity of the statement itself. The proof system was not practical, partly due to the need for interaction between the prover and verifier. Fiat-Shamir, NIZK. Maybe mention Icrementally Verifiable Computation lays the foundation for proof composition, scalability, etc.

In a leap towards practicality, [KZG10](Constant-Size Commitments to Polynomials and Their Applications) introduced a polynomial commitment scheme (aka KZG commitments) using [elliptic curve pairings](https://medium.com/@VitalikButerin/exploring-elliptic-curve-pairings-c73c1864e627) that is both efficient and succinct (constant size). Unfortunately, the security of a KZG commitment depends on a trusted *reference string* or *trusted setup*. KZG commitments were used to create the first batch of practical SNARKs: libSNARK, Pinocchio, and Groth16. These all suffer from significant per-circuit trusted setup, but are efficient and succinct. (TODO: is there a common construction here for using a polynomial commitment scheme to make a SNARK?). (TODO: describe where these were used)

Subsequently, the hunt was on for ZKPs / SNARKs that did not have the drawbacks of a trusted setup.

Several ZKPs avoided KZG commitments and trusted setup entirely: Hyrax, Ligero, Bulletproofs (IPA from Bootle '16), STARKs, Fractal, Aurora, and others. These avoid a trusted setup, but at the cost of larger proofs and slower verifiers.

- Hyrax employes a new commitment scheme for multilinear polynomials.
- STARks are built with polynomial IOPs and FRI. Avoids elliptic curve cryptography.
- Ligero: 

In 2018, Jens Groth introduced Updateabe and Universal Common Reference Strings. The idea here was to retain the efficiency of pairing-based SNARKs while addressing some of the problems with trusted setup. I think this leads to Sonic, PLONK, and Marlin.

### Recursion




## A Comparison

To create some perspective, the following table puts things into chronological order and highlights some significant properties. It is derived from [a spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mCKR41t9piQ0HV7JOt2bYhaOElHc6kGe_-5M09sDBaY/edit?usp=sharing) I keep. The spreadsheet which may be more complete and up to date.

*Caveat:* The asymptotics for prover time, proof length, and verifier time are not exactly apples to apples. Different authors define their inputs in different ways and this table does not attempt to unify their notations.

[On the Size of Pairing-based Non-interactive Arguments?](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/260)


- **Trusted Setup** Groth16 requires a trusted setup, meaning it has an initial phase where cryptographic parameters (public and private keys) are generated. This phase must be conducted honestly by participants or a trusted authority because any compromise in this phase could lead to security issues, such as creating fake proofs.
The trusted setup involves creating the Structured Reference String (SRS), a set of public parameters that will be used in all future proof generations and verifications.

- **Efficient Proof Generation** The proof generation process in Groth16 is relatively efficient compared to other zk-SNARK systems, though it still requires considerable computational resources. This efficiency is achieved through pre-processed circuit representations and arithmetic encodings of statements.

- **Small Proof Size** Groth16 is extremely efficient in terms of proof size. It produces constant-sized proofs, typically 128 bytes long, regardless of the complexity of the statement being proven.
This is one of the smallest proof sizes among zk-SNARKs, which is beneficial for reducing the data footprint, especially in blockchain systems where storage space is a critical resource.

- **Constant-time verification** Verification time does not grow with the size of the computation being proved.

For more, [Remco Bloemen's notes](https://xn--2-umb.com/22/groth16/) are an excellent overview.
