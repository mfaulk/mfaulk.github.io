## The Evolution of Zero-Knowledge Proofs: A Timeline and Comparison

The field of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) has seen some amazing advances in the last several years. All of that progress, though, makes it difficult to keep up with the state of the art and see how all the pieces fit together. This post is my (ongoing) attempt to follow the impactful developments and trace some of the lines of inquiry.


To create some perspective, the following table puts things into chronological order and highlights some significant properties. It is derived from [a spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mCKR41t9piQ0HV7JOt2bYhaOElHc6kGe_-5M09sDBaY/edit?usp=sharing) I keep. The spreadsheet which may be more complete and up to date.

*Caveat:* The asymptotics for prover time, proof length, and verifier time are not exactly apples to apples. Different authors define their inputs in different ways and this table does not yet attempt to unify their notations.
