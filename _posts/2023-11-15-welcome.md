## Welcome!

I am an engineer, entrepreneur, and applied cryptographer. I helped create the [MobileCoin](https://mobilecoin.com/) cryptocurrency used 
by the Signal private messenger. At the moment, I am working on a startup using zero-knowledge proofs and writing a lot of Rust code. 

I am starting this blog to share my thoughts on math, privacy, and security -- but most of all, because I want to 
connect with **you**. If you find something here interesting, **please reach out and let me know!** I'd love to hear 
from you. 

$\circ$ Shout out to [Henrik Karlsson](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/search-query) for the motivation I needed to get started.
