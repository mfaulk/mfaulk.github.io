## Welcome!

I am an engineer, entrepreneur, and applied cryptographer. I am starting this blog to share my thoughts on 
technology, privacy, and security -- but most of all, because I want to connect with you.

I am currently spending much of my time building zero-knowledge proof systems and writing Rust code, and so I expect 
that many of my posts will be about cryptography, cryptocurrency, zero-knowledge proofs, and Rust.

$\circ$ Shout out to [Henrik Karlsson](https://www.henrikkarlsson.xyz/p/search-query) and [Chad Baldwin](https://chadbaldwin.net/2021/03/14/how-to-build-a-sql-blog.html) for the motivation I needed to get started.
