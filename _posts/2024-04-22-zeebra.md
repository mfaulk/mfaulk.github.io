## Zeebra: ZEro-knowledge algEBRA

![Zeebra](../assets/zeebra.jpg "Zeebra is ZEro knowledge algeBRA")

Introducing **[Zeebra](https://github.com/mfaulk/zeebra)**, a Rust library for zero-knowledge cryptography. Zeebra 
implements a subset of computational algebra and number theory for zero-knowledge cryptography. It contains many 
of the core algebraic structures and operations needed for zero-knowledge proofs, including big integers, finite 
fields, polynomials, and linear algebra. While there are several very good algebra libraries in Rust, I think 
Zeebra stands out for its clarity and enthusiastic use of property-based testing.

### What's next?
I wrote Zeebra as a learning exercise, and its future growth will depend on my future interests and the interest of the 
community. Right now, I'm interested in polynomial system solving and am building out the Grobner basis functionality.

Please give **[Zeebra](https://github.com/mfaulk/zeebra)** a look! I'd love to hear your feedback.
