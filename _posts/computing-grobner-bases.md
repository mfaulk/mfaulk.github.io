## Solving Polynomial Systems with Gröbner Bases

Today, I want to solve some systems of polynomial equations over finite fields. I'll be using Gröbner bases, and 
will be working in Julia.  

Why? It happens that I'm working with "ZK-Friendly" hash functions like Poseidon and Rescue. Unlike most hash functions 
that are designed to be efficiently computable on modern CPUs, these hash functions are designed to have concise algebraic 
descriptions so that they can be efficiently computed in zero-knowledge proofs. As a result, the security of these 
hash functions hinges on the difficulty of solving particular systems of polynomial equations over large finite 
fields -- so-called "Gröbner basis attacks". The assumption is that this is hard, and in fact the worst-case 
complexity for computing Gröbner bases is doubly-exponential in the number of variables. Of course, worst-case 
analysis can be misleading -- solving a system of *linear* polynomials is easy -- and so my interest lies in 
exploring the question, when is it feasible to solve a system of non-linear equations?

 
# Polynomial Systems
A polynomial system over a finite field is a collection of polynomial equations where the coefficients and variables 
belong to a finite field. Solutions to the system are sets of field elements that simultaneously satisfy all the 
equations in the system.


# What is a Gröbner Basis?
- Compare with Gaussian Elimination.
- Definition
- Ideals

By computing a Gröbner basis for the ideal generated by the polynomial equations in the system, we can transform the 
system into an equivalent one that is easier to solve. This process often simplifies the task of finding solutions 
in Fp, as the Gröbner basis can lead to a triangular form where the equations can be solved sequentially.  


# Solving a Polynomial System via Gröbner Bases
The bad news first: the worst-case complexity of computing a Gröbner basis is **doubly-exponential** in the number of 
variables. In general, computing Gröbner bases is EXPSPACE-complete.

# And now for some code
There are a few different tools for computing Gröbner bases.

- https://ederc.github.io/GroebnerBasis.jl/
- SageMath
- Maple
- MagMa
- Singular

# Final Thoughts
- Seems like there is a disconnect between tools for computing Gröbner bases the software used in the cryptocurrency 
  world. The former is dominated by academic tools, while the latter is dominated by Rust. The crypto world needs 
  better tools (in Rust) for computing Gröbner bases over larger finite fields (e.g. 2^256). 
- Working with non-linear algebra is hard. There isn't a lot of software available to experiment with. I was excited 
  to see some new packages in Julia. These are great, but they top out at finite fields with 32-bit or 64-bit prime 
  modulus. That's not bad, but there's still a disconnect between applications in cryptography and the available 
  tooling.
